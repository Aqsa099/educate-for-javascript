    <!--  The process of finding the largest value (i.e., the maximum of a group of values) is used
          frequently in computer applications.For example,a script that determines the winner of a sales 
		  contest would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. 
		  The sales person who sells the most units wins the contest. 
		  Write a pseudocode algorithm and then a script that inputs a series of 10 single digit numbers as
		  characters, determines the largest of the numbers and outputs a message that displays the largest number.
		  Your script should use three variables as follows:
		  a) counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been
 		     input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed);
		  b) number: The current digit input to the script; 
		  c) largest: The largest number found so far.  -->
		 
	<script>
	
	   var count = 1;
	   var number;
	   var largest = 0;
	   while(count < 10)
	   {
	        number = parseInt(prompt("Enter the number: "));
			count++;
			
			if(number > largest)
			{
			    largest = number;
			}
		
	   }
	        window.alert("the largest value is: "+ largest);      
	</script>
