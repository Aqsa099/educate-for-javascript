        <!--  Develop a script that will determine whether a department-store customer has exceeded 
		      the credit limit on a charge account. For each customer, the following facts are available:
			  a) Account number 
			  b) Balance at the beginning of the month 
			  c) Total of all items charged by this customer this month 
			  d) Total of all credits applied to this customer's account this month 
			  e) Allowed credit limit The script should input each of these facts from a prompt dialog as an
    			 integer, calculate the new balance (= beginning balance + charges – credits), display the new 
				 balance and determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer’s credit limit.
				 For customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the script should output HTML5 text 
				 that displays the message “Credit limit exceeded.”-->
		<script>
		        var accountNumber, balanceBegining, charge, credit, totalBalance, creditLimit;
				
				accountNumber = parseInt(prompt("Enter your account number: "));
				balanceBegining = parseInt(prompt("Balance at the beginning of the month : "));
				charge = parseInt(prompt("Total of all items charged by this customer this month : "));
				credit = parseInt(prompt("Enter the credit: "));
			    creditLimit = parseInt(prompt("Enter the credit limit: "));
				
				totalBalance = (balanceBegining + charge - credit);
				
				window.alert("The total balance is: " + totalBalance);
				
				if(totalBalance > creditLimit)
				{
				    window.alert("Credit Limit Exceeded! ");
				}
